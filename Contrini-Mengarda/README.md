To install and execute the simulator, make sure you have Java 11 installed on your machine.

Proceed with the installation by launching the `distributedgroup_project2.jar` file. Then, to run the simulator open the installation folder and double-click the `start_model.bat` or `start_model.command` file depending on your operating system.
